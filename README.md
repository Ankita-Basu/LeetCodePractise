# LeetCode Progress Tracker

## Overview


This repository functions as a tracker for my LeetCode progress, documenting solutions to diverse coding challenges. Its purpose is to record my coding journey, share insights, and monitor my ongoing progress.
## Folder Structure

- Each problem is organized into its own directory within the "solutions" folder.
- The directory name includes the problem's title and LeetCode ID.

## Version Control

- Git is utilized to track changes and manage different versions of my solutions.
- Commits are made after successfully solving a problem or making significant improvements.

## Important Notes

- Not all versions of code/solutions might be accepted by LeetCode, and that's okay. The primary focus is on learning and improvement.

## How to Navigate

1. Browse the "solutions" folder to find problems categorized by LeetCode ID.
2. Each problem directory contains the solution code, along with any supporting files.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or join me in this coding journey!
